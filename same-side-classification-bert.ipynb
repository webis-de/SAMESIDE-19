      "\"2\",\"first i want to thank my opponent for letting me speak. i became extremely busy having to handle school and practice. i first wold like to present my counter argument against my opponents statement \\\" women don't just abort when they aren't willing to raise a child\\\". my evidence is found at: http://www.womenscenter.com... i would like to highlight this section: the most common underlying reasons for abortion were 1) they could not afford a child at the time and were unmarried (42%), 2) it would interfere with their education (38%), 3) it would interfere with their employment (38%), and 4) they were students or planning to enroll in studies (34%). other reasons are having relationship problems, not ready for another child, or don\\\"t want people to know they had sex or got pregnant, the health of the fetus, victim of rape, or became pregnant as result of incest. the number one reason does have to financial reasons, but it does say that other reasons are because a) the infant would interfere with their job b) they were not ready c) or they did want people to know that they are pregnant. you might say it is unethical to abort a life or potential life because you don't want you ego to be affected, r because it would interfere with your job. most woman who have a child usually have interference with their job because of a child. you might say that if they were scared of these reasons they would not have had sex in the first place. it also says that there are abortions because of rap and incest based on ]http://www.infoplease.com...; every year there are around 1.3 abortions per year only 13,000 are because of rape or incest which equals 1%. this means that 99% of women who have abortions had sex willingly then got pregnant and either realized they would could not provide all they needed to for the child, or they said oh crap i want to go to college, i don't want to be tired at work, or my boyfriend always is yelling and i cant handle the stress etc. it also states that many women had previous abortions.\",\"100c174f-2019-04-18T17:33:51Z-00001-000\",\"this is my first debate so please just bare with me. i have had this argument before, but it was me vs. 6 catholics and they wouldn't let me speak, and just decided that they won. plus they were very aggressive. my point is that people who go and have sex and get pregnant then just because they don't want a child, or feel they aren't ready, should not get the option of abortion. i then feel that the people who are raped, abused, or could possibly die during the pregnancy or birthing process should get that option. for the person who would like to challenge me they can either choose abortion should be completely legal, or it should be completely illegal. how its going to go: 1) my opponent should next try to counter and give the reasons for why the way they feel about the topic is the the way they feel 2) i will then argue why you are wrong or flawed. and then the process will be repeated by you 3)just be nice, i don't want to go back to the argument against the six catholics again. 4) voters just go for who you felt had a better argument 5) i would be happy to except any other persons debate on this topic, i also appreciate to see your comments\",\"100c174f-2019-04-18T17:33:51Z-00001-000\",\"100c174f-2019-04-18T17:33:51Z\",\"True\",\"abortion should be illegal with exceptions\"\n",
